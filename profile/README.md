## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ENBREA is a modular, cloud-based school management software and suitable for all types and sizes of schools, multi-tenant capable, has open interfaces and is open source.

ENBREA can be used as turnkey Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or installed locally on your own server. There is no need to install and maintain workstations. A current web browser on one's own notebook or tablet is all that is needed to work with ENBREA.
